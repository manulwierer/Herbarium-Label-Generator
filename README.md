# Herbarium-Label-Generator
This simple python script is a herbarium label generator that enables easy creation of pdf files from .csv or .xlsx tables. I created this because other open projects did not quite have what I wanted for my personal herbarium. If you`d like deep integration with iNaturalist this is not for you.
